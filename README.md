# DSA-ML Capstone - Mobile Price Prediction

This is the final capstone project for my Data Science and Machine Learning course. The goal of this project is to predict the price range of mobile devices using various hardware and feature attributes like battery power, RAM, screen size, camera quality, and more.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing features of mobile phones (e.g., battery power, RAM, internal memory, etc.), the task is to build a classification model that predicts the price range of the phone, categorized into 4 classes:
- 0: Low Cost
- 1: Medium Cost
- 2: High Cost
- 3: Very High Cost

## üßæ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `mobile_data.csv`, which contains **21 features** and **1 target variable (`price_range`).
